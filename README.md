# code2040-api-challenge
Repository used for the API Challenge/Tech Assessment that is part of the CODE2040's 2017 Fellows Application. 

The strategy I used for solving the challenge is creating HTML files with script tags where I wrote JavaScript code used to send HTTP requests to the API Challenge endpoints. I chose to solve the challenge this way since I have previous experience with Web Development and the MEAN stack (so, experience with JS), and since after finishing to write the code, simply opening one HTML file in my web browser would complete a step of the challenge. Each HTML file in this repository contains the solution for a different step of the challenge: 

- Step 1: register.html
- Step 2: reverse.html
- Step 3: haystack.html
- Step 4: prefix.html
- Step 5: dating.html
