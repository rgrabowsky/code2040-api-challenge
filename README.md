# code2040-api-challenge
Repository used for the API Challenge/Tech Assessment that is part of the CODE2040's 2017 Fellows Application. 

The strategy I used for solving the challenge is creating HTML files with script tags where I wrote JavaScript code to send HTTP requests to the API Challenge endpoints. Each HTML file in this repository contains the solution for a different step of the challenge: 

- Step 1: register.html
- Step 2: reverse.html
- Step 3: haystack.html
- Step 4: prefix.html
- Step 5: dating.html
